### **FindZ: A Smart Vehicle Tracking and Navigation Solution**

**Problem:**  
Finding a car in large parking lots or multi-level garages is frustrating, as traditional navigation apps like Google Maps only work outdoors in 2D. Additionally, vehicle theft creates anxiety for car owners who cannot track their car's precise location.

**Solution:**  
FindZ combines **GPS** (for long-range tracking), **UWB** (Ultra-Wideband for precise short-range tracking), and a **barometric altimeter** (to determine floor level) to guide users to their car, indoors or outdoors. The mobile app integrates **AR (Augmented Reality)** to overlay navigation arrows and provides real-time updates through IoT-connected sensors in the vehicle.
